Proposal 1
Facebook relies on an algorithm as well as individual usersâ€™ reports to identify content that is potentially "fake news." 
Once the content has been identified, it is sent to third party fact-checkers for verification. 
If the content is verified as fake news, it is publicly flagged with a warning that the content is disputed by fact-checkers.


Proposal 2
However, a designer at Facebook believes that there needs to be a different approach to content regulation. 
Their proposal is that content deemed problematic by third-party fact-checkers should be prevented from being shared on the platform altogether.
