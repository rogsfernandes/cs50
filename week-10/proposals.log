Proposal 1
Facebook relies on an algorithm as well as individual usersâ€™ reports to identify content that is potentially "fake news." 
Once the content has been identified, it is sent to third party fact-checkers for verification. 
If the content is verified as fake news, it is publicly flagged with a warning that the content is disputed by fact-checkers.


Proposal 2
However, a designer at Facebook believes that there needs to be a different approach to content regulation. 
Their proposal is that content deemed problematic by third-party fact-checkers should be prevented from being shared on the platform altogether. 


Questions
Which form of content regulation, Proposal 1 or Proposal 2, do you feel is better? Why?
- Answer: I think the first proposal is better because it assures the right to expressive freedom that individuals should have in a well-functioning democratic public sphere. The person who is sharing the news may not know that this content is not reliable, so the addition of a warning message proposed by Regine Rini also can increase the quality of the public sphere discussions. And if the person still wants to share that content, to the link should be added the warning that this information is contested publicly by fact-checkers.
