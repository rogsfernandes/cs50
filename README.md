# CS50 Tasks


This is my personal take on Harvard's CS50 programs (Web, AI and Games) in order to acquire foundational knowledge on the Art of Computer Programming (Big O Notation, Algorithms, Data Structures, etc.) and more!

**__Very Important__:** This repository serves only for personal progress register and curiosity purposes. **You should not use it as a source of solutions for the problems of the Edx course's CS50x, because this action would be against the [ethic code](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/) that you need to follow in order to complete the course correctly**. Use this only after you provide your working answer to compare different solutions or to suggest enhancements (please!). Remember that you have access to [communities](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/communities/) that will help you complete your journey. This is an awesome course and I really hope that you will respect the staff work and commit to the ethic code! Thank you!
